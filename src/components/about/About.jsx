          <h1>Meet Dr. Apurv Mehra</h1>
          <h2>Where Expertise Meets Empathy</h2>
          <p>
            Behind every successful surgery and every confident step a patient
            takes toward recovery stands a doctor who goes beyond the call of
            duty — not just treating bodies, but touching lives. Dr. Apurv Mehra
            is one such name.
            <br />
            <br />
            Renowned for his excellence in{" "}
            <b>robotic knee and hip replacement</b>, Dr. Mehra brings more than
            just surgical skill to the table — he brings{" "}
            <b>comfort, clarity, and compassion</b> to every patient he meets.
            His patients often say that before healing even begins physically,
            it begins the moment they sit across from him and feel truly heard.
            <br />
            <br />
            For over <b>15 years</b>, Dr. Mehra has served not only as a surgeon
            but as a mentor, teacher, and guide. He has inspired a generation of
            young doctors, many of whom chose orthopedics simply because of his
            influence. His commitment to <b>uplifting the profession</b> and
            society at large is evident in every life he touches — be it in the
            operating theatre, in classrooms, or in communities.
            <br />
            <br />
            What sets him apart is his belief that{" "}
            <b>technology should never replace human connection</b>. His
            approach blends the <b>precision of robotic surgery</b> with the{" "}
            <b>art of compassionate care</b>, ensuring that every patient not
            only walks better — but lives better.
            <br />
            <br />
            Whether you meet him as a doctor, a teacher, or simply a reassuring
            presence during a difficult time —{" "}
            <b>Dr. Apurv Mehra’s dedication is unmistakable</b>.
            <br />
            He heals not just joints, but journeys.
            <br />
            He restores not just mobility, but <b>hope and dignity</b>.
