    para: `<h2>A Humble Beginning</h2>


    I often say I belong to a very rich family—not because of money, but because of love and values. We lived in a single room where my grandparents slept on the bed and the rest of us around them. Owning even a bed of my own felt like a distant dream.

    I still remember how strange it felt to see someone eat an entire fruit. We would wonder in awe—how could someone have a whole fruit to themselves? I promised myself that if God ever blessed me, I would one day eat a fruit without sharing it. That small dream taught me a big lesson: <b>richness isn’t about wealth, it’s about the richness of upbringing, love, and values.</b>

<h2>The Balloon Battle</h2>

When I was six, my father took me to the Bada market in Gwalior. There was a balloon seller with bright blue fish-shaped balloons and red heart-shaped ones. I was obsessed.

But balloons were expensive. Each time I asked, my father would say, “Tomorrow.” I didn’t understand “tomorrow.” I wanted them now. I fought, rolled in mud, pulled the balloon seller’s cycle, and refused to give up. Finally, after 20 minutes of chaos, I walked home like a king—muddy, clothes torn, clutching a blue and a red balloon.

That day I learned something that shaped my life: <b>if you’re ready to give it everything—your comfort, your pride—you’ll get your balloon.</b>

In life, balloons change shape. They become your dream college, the car you want to drive, the hospital you wish to build, the exam you want to crack. But the rule remains the same: <b>you must fight for it, no matter how dirty you get or who laughs at you.</b>


<h2>Dreamers vs. Doers</h2>

Everyone has a dream. The real test begins when hard work starts. If you want to succeed, measure your effort every single day.

Before sleeping, look in the mirror and ask:

• Did I give my best today?

• Could I do more tomorrow?

If you promise yourself to improve—even a little—every day, your dreams will turn real. <b>The hardest person to lie to is yourself.</b>

<h2>Parents: The True Source of Strength</h2>

Many students forget to thank their parents when they succeed. But trust me, nothing matters more than their blessings. Call them. Talk to them. Your mental strength, especially during exams like NEET PG or INICET, often comes from their unwavering belief in you.

Remember this: human beings define institutions, not the other way around. Your rank, not the coaching centre, defines your success.

<h2>The Equation of Effort</h2>

Life is like Bhaskaracharya’s famous equation from the Mahabharata, which calculates how many arrows Arjuna needed to defeat Karna.

• <b>50%</b> of arrows stop Karna’s attacks – that’s you fighting your own laziness.

• <b>40%</b> control your senses and distractions.

• <b>6%</b> deal with people who discourage you.

• <b>3%</b> break the chariot—your environment.

• And <b>1 arrow</b> decides the final victory.

That last arrow is unpredictable. It represents that final exam question, that last push of effort. <b>Ninety-nine per cent is your preparation. The final 1%—call it luck, call it divine intervention—belongs to God.</b>

<h2>Focus Like Arjuna</h2>

In the Mahabharata, when Arjuna aimed at the rotating fish’s eye, Shri Krishna told him:

• Ignore the noise around you.

• See only the eye.

• Overshoot slightly—because the target moves.

• Trust your preparation.

When Arjuna asked, “What will you do, Lord?” Krishna replied, “I will hold the water still.”
That’s the final 0.1%—the unseen force, the blessing, the grace that meets your hard work.

<h2>The Takeaway for Aspirants</h2>

Whether it’s NEET PG, INICET, or any dream you chase:

• <b>Show up daily.</b>

• <b>Fight for your balloons.</b>

• <b>Measure your effort.</b>

• <b>Thank your parents.</b>

• <b>Believe in that last arrow.</b>

Give your 99%. Let God hold the water still for the final 1%. And when you finally hold your “balloon,” walk like a king—because you earned it.

    para: `When I look at NEET PG preparation, I see more than an exam. I see a journey that will test your patience, resilience, and belief in yourself. Let me share a few thoughts that I hold close—lessons from my own experience and from the students I have mentored over the years.

<h2>Someone Is Always Studying</h2>

Even if I have a fever, someone somewhere is still reading. That thought has always stayed with me. You may feel tired or distracted, but remember: someone is working while you pause. On exam day, that person might come back like a boomerang and stand right in front of you. You will not even see it coming.

The real fight is not inside the exam hall; it is in the hours you choose to give, even when it is uncomfortable.

<h2>No One Scores 100%</h2>

There will be a bad patch in your exam.

• I remember my own All India test—my first thirteen questions were wrong. A senior who had topped PGI told me, "It's okay. Keep going."

• That advice stayed with me. Nobody scores 100% in an entrance exam. Even board toppers who have scored full marks do not achieve that here.

• Accept that you will not know everything. Move on. The fight is in not giving up when the paper tries to break you.

<h2>A Rank Opens Doors for Many</h2>

A rank is not just a number. One good rank opens doors for your entire community, your college, and often your entire state. Your juniors watch you. Your friends look up to you. What you write today becomes a hope for many others. That is why how you fight matters even more than the result itself.

<h2>Depth, Not Breadth</h2>

The differentiator in these exams is never a brand-new question. It is the depth with which you have mastered the predictable topics. Go vertical, not horizontal. Read questions carefully, understand how they are framed, and practice ruling out options. Reading and solving are different skills. Learn both.

<h2>Win the Crucial Points</h2>

There is only one sport in the world where you can lose more points and still win the match—tennis. Carlos Alcaraz lost more points in the French Open final, but he became the champion because he won the crucial ones.

Entrance exams are the same. You don't need to win every point; you need to win the ones that matter.

<h2>Believe Beyond Boundaries</h2>

Before 2015, many believed only students from a handful of elite colleges could crack AIIMS or INI-CET. Then Dr. Ravi and Dr. Zainab proved that wrong. They came from ordinary backgrounds and showed that your college doesn't define your destiny. Their journey inspires me even today. Passion and relentless work will always be stronger than a name on your degree.

<h2>My Advice for NEET PG, INICET & FMGE Aspirants</h2>

• If you give two days to Orthopedics or Anesthesia, stop at the deadline. Perfection is an illusion.

• Beware of the first option in an MCQ. The first love often deceives.

• Respect others' focus. Do not disturb those who are fighting their own battle beside you.

<h2>BTR Is a Checklist, Not Just a Book</h2>

The BTR book is like a beautifully orchestrated piece of music. It is not about collecting more and more information. It is about knowing when to stop, what to revise, and what to let go. That is why it is the number one resource today—it gives you a sequence and a checklist you can trust.

<h2>Final Words</h2>

You are not known by how much money you earn. You are known by the difference you create. Believe that you can make an impact. Fight through the difficult patches. Go deep into the core topics.

The winner is not the one who never falls, but the one who refuses to stop playing the game.
