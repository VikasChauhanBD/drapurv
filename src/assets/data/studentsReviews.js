I am so grateful to exist in this era so that I can experience the greatness with my own eyes. As the name says, we all got a new 'jeevan' by learning this 'vidya' of how and what to study. Also, Team Cerebellum has always been so cooperative and supportive that you won't have to worry about anything else except studying. ",
